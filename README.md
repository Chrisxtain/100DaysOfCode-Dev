# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

Welcome to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge repository! This is a place where we will be building a new project or solving a coding task every day for 100 days. Our goal is to practice and improve our skills in fullstack web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, we plan to introduce React and Python as well.

## How to Participate

1. **Fork this Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository to create your own copy.
2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/100DaysOfCode.git
   ```

## Set Up Your Environment

1. **Install a Code Editor:** We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for its powerful features and extensive plugin ecosystem. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install Git:** If you don't already have Git installed, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/). Git will allow you to manage your code and push it to GitHub.
3. **Set Up GitHub:** Make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can create it [here](https://github.com/). This will be where you store and showcase your projects.

## Start Coding

1. **Navigate to the Day's Folder:** Open your code editor and navigate to the folder for the day's challenge (e.g., `Day1`).
2. **Review the Instructions:** Each day's folder contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions and requirements for the project or task. Read through it carefully to understand what you need to build.
3. **Open the Starter Files:** The folder will also contain starter files like `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`. Open these files in your code editor to get started.
4. **Build Your Project:** Use the provided starter code as a foundation and build upon it to complete the day's challenge. Don't forget to test your project in a web browser to ensure it works as expected.

## Commit Your Work

1. **Stage Your Changes:** Open a terminal or command prompt in your project directory and stage your changes using the following command:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

## Challenge Structure

Each day's challenge will be structured as follows:

- **Day Folder:** Each day will have its own folder, e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.
- **Starter Files:** Each folder will contain starter files and preliminary code to help you get started.
- **README:** Each day's folder will have a README file with detailed instructions and requirements for the project or task.
