## Instructions

### Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Day 2 Folder:** Open your code editor and navigate to the `Day2` folder.
2. **Review the Starter Files:** The folder contains the following starter files:
   - `index.html`: The HTML structure of the quiz.
   - `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the quiz.
   - `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling quiz logic.
3. **Open the README:** Read through the `README.md` file in the `Day2` folder for detailed instructions and requirements.

### Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Set Up the Quiz Structure:**

   - Open `index.html` and set up the basic structure of the quiz, including sections for the question, options, progress bar, and timer.
   - Ensure each section has appropriate IDs or classes for easy targeting with JavaScript.

2. **Style the Quiz:**

   - Open `styles.css` and style the quiz to make it visually appealing.
   - Add CSS animations for transitions between questions and for correct/incorrect feedback.
   - Ensure the quiz is fully responsive using media queries.

3. **Implement Quiz Logic:**

   - Open `script.js` and write JavaScript functions to handle the quiz logic.
   - Implement functions to load questions, handle user selections, update the score, and manage the timer.
   - Randomize the order of questions and options to ensure a different experience each time.

4. **Store High Scores:**

   - Use `localStorage` to store high scores and display them to the user.

5. **Add Sound Effects:**

   - Use the Web Audio API to play sound effects for correct and incorrect answers.

6. **Test the Quiz:**

   - Test the quiz in different browsers and devices to ensure it works as expected.
   - Check for accessibility by using screen readers and ensuring proper labels and ARIA attributes are in place.

7. **Commit Your Work:**
   - Stage your changes using `git add .`.
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Completed Day 2 challenge: Interactive Quiz Application"`.
   - Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin main`.

### Stretch Goals

- **Additional Features:** Add more features such as hints, explanations for answers, or a leaderboard.
- **Advanced Animations:** Implement more advanced animations using CSS or JavaScript libraries.
- **Database Integration:** Store questions and high scores in a database for a more scalable solution.
