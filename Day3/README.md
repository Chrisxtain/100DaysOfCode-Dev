# Day 3: Simple To-Do List Application

## Project Description

Welcome to Day 3 of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge! Today, you will build a simple to-do list application. This project will help you practice your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a dynamic to-do list that allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The tasks will be saved to local storage to persist between sessions.

## Features to Implement

- **Add New Tasks Dynamically:** Allow users to add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Enable users to mark tasks as completed.
- **Delete Tasks:** Allow users to delete tasks from the list.
- **Save Tasks to Local Storage:** Ensure tasks persist between sessions using local storage.

## Instructions

### Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Day 3 Folder:** Open your code editor and navigate to the `Day3` folder.
2. **Review the Starter Files:** The folder contains the following starter files:
   - `index.html`: The HTML structure of the to-do list.
   - `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the to-do list.
   - `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling to-do list functionality.
3. **Open the README:** Read through the `README.md` file in the `Day3` folder for detailed instructions and requirements.

### Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Set Up the HTML Structure:**

   - Open `index.html` and set up the basic structure of the to-do list, including an input field for new tasks, an add button, and a list to display tasks.

2. **Style the To-Do List:**

   - Open `styles.css` and style the to-do list to make it visually appealing. Ensure the list items are styled to show completed tasks clearly.

3. **Implement JavaScript Functionality:**

   - Open `script.js` and write JavaScript functions to handle adding, marking as completed, and deleting tasks.
   - Use `localStorage` to save tasks so they persist between sessions.

4. **Test the To-Do List:**

   - Test the to-do list in different browsers to ensure it works as expected.
   - Check for accessibility by using screen readers and ensuring proper labels and ARIA attributes are in place.

5. **Commit Your Work:**
   - Stage your changes using `git add .`.
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Completed Day 3 challenge: Simple To-Do List Application"`.
   - Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin main`.

### Stretch Goals

- **Implement Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Allow users to reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them.
- **Add a Search Bar:** Implement a search bar to filter tasks based on user input.
